Dunya Moss's Statement:
I would like to give thanks and acknowledge my colleagues Cassandra Johnson, Tucker Serwadda, and Ursuela Simmons, for their help and support with this assignment. Together I belive we have create a unguely afficient App. Our project manager Cassandra Johnson did a wonderful job as Scrum manager.

I would also like to thank Meagan Ramey, Manny Ledoux, Pete Mayor, Elly and TJ Hindman for their help when challenges arose.

One the of the biggest challeneges I faced had to do withthe message delete with post message request, CSS and styling. My referances were W3Schools, Agata Krzywda from Codeburst.io, MDN and Live Blooger's How to Animate with SVG. I had a very difficult time rendering my creative ideas unto the site, such as animating text and SVG graphics. Somethings just didn't work or was not compatible, which influenced my design of the website. I was trying to go for a 90-like retro theme. I did enjoy working with CSS. It is a skill I would like to master. Another challenge faced was a google login. I researced what I thought was the best way to connect, however not the best for our assignment. Learning both ways really helped me to understand the process better.

The one thing I am proud of is the article links with search bar. That aspect of the APP help to link everything together and showed me I new way of connecting to information. The navbar took me a bit to code but was the easiest to understand.

All in all the assignment was difficult as I am new to coding but very informative.
